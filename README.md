This is a test task to find similar element in html as in origin document

Parameters for run:
    1. Origin path - can be as path to file or URL.
    2. Source path - can be as path to file or URL.
    
If parameters were not set, sources are set by defoult from project folder "html".

Element in origin is found by id "make-everything-ok-button". After that all parameters are set as values for different search methods
Task must be tested and optimised (maybe some abstraction must be included) but I tried to make it within 3 hours.
